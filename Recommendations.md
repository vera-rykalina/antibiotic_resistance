Nexflow pipeline to determine antibiotic resistance
====
# Recommendations:

### Recommendation for Patient 1
Patient1 has no "Tet*" in srst2 result. This patient should
be prescribed tetracyclines. Patient1 should get an antibiotic of priority 1: Doxycycline.

### Recommentation for Patient 2
Patient2 has "Tet*" and "APH" in srst2 result. This patient should not
be prescribed either tetracyclines or aminoglycosides. Tet* mediates resistance to tetracyclines
and Dexocycline would fail. APH mediates resistence to aminoglycosides and Gentamicine would fail.
Patient2 should get antibiotic with priority 3: Chloramphenicol.

### Recommendation for Patient 3
Patient3 has "Tet*" in srst2 result. This patient should not
be prescribed tetracyclines.  - Tet* mediates resistance to tetracyclines doxocycline would fail. 
Patient3 should get antibiotic with priority 2: Gentamycin.
